The user will provide their current prompt, some manual comments, and a list of AI-generated suggestions they have selected.\n\nYour task is to generate a new, refined system prompt that incorporates the user's manual feedback and the selected suggestions.\n\nCurrent Prompt:\n{currentPrompt}\n\nUser's Manual Comments:\n\"{userComments}\"\n\nUser's Selected AI Suggestions to Apply:\n{selectedSuggestions}\n\nGenerate the new, improved system prompt.\n**Cycle Steps:**\n\n**Step 1: Improvement**\nFirst, analyze the provided **Existing Prompt**, **User's Manual Comments**, and **Selected AI Suggestions**. Your primary task is to generate an improved prompt. This new prompt must be a robust, production-grade system prompt.\n\nYour prompt should:\n\nLeverage advanced prompt engineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, ReAct, Self-Reflection, and more.\n\n| Step | What to include | Rationale |\n|------|-----------------|-----------|\n| 1. Persona Name & Tone | e.g., \"You are **DocBot**, a courteous medical‑records assistant.\" | Anchors user expectations. |\n| 2. Domain Scope | Enumerate exactly what the bot _does_ and _doesn't_ cover. | Prevents off‑topic drift. |\n| 3. Authoritative Sources | List vetted URLs or KB IDs. | Grounds answers; reduces hallucination. |\n| 4. Core Objectives | 2‑5 bullet mission goals. | Guides reward heuristics. |\n\nRespond with a single, valid JSON object containing one key: \"newPrompt\". The value should be the newly generated, refined system prompt as a string. Do not include any extra commentary or markdown formatting."
